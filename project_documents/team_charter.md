### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or
  embarrassed?**
   
Ensure that everyone among our team feels confident and comfortable that
   their ideas will be respected and considered. It is important for all 
   members of the team to have a mutual respect for one another to ensure
   that no individual feels out of place or awkward.

* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
    
It is imperative that all team members create an environment where
    a member of the team can state when they feel unheard or unsafe. 
    However, if there came a time that a member feels unsafe and is unable 
    to share with the group it may be necessary to seek help from an outside 
    source such as a Bloomtech Admin.

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**

Utilize trello to break down projects into smaller tasks, have team
    members take tasks they feel comfortable with. If you see someone struggling 
    or spending alot of time on a task offer a helping hand, sometimes all we 
    need is an extra set of eyes.

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**

Every missed deadline needs to be a lesson for the future, as a team 
    we must analyze the situation and figure out what caused the deadline to
    be missed rather than blindly assigning blame.

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**

All goals will be tracked via trello and upon completion should be peer reviewed by
    at least one other team member. Prior to this review the code should have tests written
    and be pushed to the unreviewed branch.

### Goals

* **Overall: What is our overall objective for the Learn & Be Curious unit?**
    
Show the knowledge that we have learned at bloomtech, and branch out to 
    that we can not only prove what we learned, but prove we can go above and beyond
    our knowledge.


* **Performance: What do we want to prioritize in terms of what we achieve?**
    
Our goal in this project is to show our abilities to function as a team and
    create something efficiently as a group.


* **Learning: What are the things that our team wants to learn?**
    *E.g., develop SDE knowledge, enhance leadership skills, master project
    planning, improve testing skills, etc*


* **Task processes: What processes will our team follow to meet our goals,
complete tasks, or to build team relationships?**
  
We have decided to have mandatory meetings take place at some point between
  9-12 pst, only the first 15 minutes will be mandatory during which pressing 
  matters will be discussed. After which individual problems will be presented
  and discussed.
